# calculator
Using tkinter and python create a calculator with basic operations such as: addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.

This is my second application in tkinter with python, it's relatively simple, to run the application just do the following:

1) clone the repository using "git clone plus the repository url"
2) through your terminal enter the folder called calculator
3) Once you have entered the folder via terminal, run the following command: on Windows: python calculadora.py - on macOS: python3 calculator.py
4) Done! You can now use this simple application
